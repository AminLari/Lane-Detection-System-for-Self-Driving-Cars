## Features

- Accurate lane detection using deep learning (U-Net architecture).
- Comparison and evaluation of results using custom metrics.
- Modular and extensible TypeScript codebase.
- Integration of computer vision libraries and tools.
- Real-time lane detection capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow.js**: For implementing the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV.js**: For image preprocessing and computer vision tasks.
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Optional): For prototyping and comparing results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (for preprocessing and dataset preparation)

### Installation
